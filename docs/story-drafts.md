# Story drafts and how to write scenes

Everything listed here is **draft writing**. Days 1–3 are on their second draft (M5), written against `docs/voice.md` for you to edit and sign off; everything after Day 3 is first draft. Days 7–11 and 13–20 got theirs in M7. Phase 2 (after M7) filled out Days 4–6, added ten story souls, and gave every choice that nothing read yet a later consequence. A scene stays marked `# draft` until you sign it off (delete the tag, or run `pnpm story:approve`). The compiler counts the drafts: `pnpm content:compile --all` prints `N scenes, N draft, ~W words` per target.

## Reviewing the story

`pnpm story:script` writes the whole story as one page, `dist/story-script/index.html`: every day's scenes in order, as the game plays them. Each line keeps its line number in the `.ink` file. The page shows:

- who speaks each line;
- each option, when it's offered at all, and what it needs (rings);
- conditions, in words ("If Ulf is at home");
- what a choice changes: rings, a power's standing, a family member, a story flag;
- for each flag a choice sets, where the story reads it again.

The page also has:

- the day's decree and the story souls at the gate, with what their stamps set;
- the endings and the journal's threads, with their conditions in words;
- an index of every flag: what sets it, and which scenes, endings and threads read it. A flag nothing reads yet is a choice with no later consequence.

Every scene has **Approve** and **Needs changes** buttons and a note. Claude can publish the page to you as a private artifact. There, your review is kept with the page, and Claude can read it and apply it. Opened as a local file, the page keeps the review in your browser instead: **Copy review** gives you text to paste to Claude, including the command that signs off the approved scenes. A scene that has been rewritten since you reviewed it says so.

`pnpm story:approve d1.morning d3.night` signs scenes off. It removes each one's `# draft` line and the draft note under it, and changes nothing else.

What the drafts set up, so a rewrite can keep or change it on purpose:

- **Day 1:** Skögul trains you: the stamp, the wage, two forgiven mistakes, the brass pin for catching liars. The first letter home is from Ulf; Grandfather died of sickness (so he's in Hel, not Valhalla, and Asa doesn't know). Writing the truth tells only Ulf.
- **Day 2:** The quartermaster's birch-bark decree. Ulf loses his boatyard work and mends Old Hrolf's nets; the roof over Asa's bed needs 5 rings (`roof_mended`), and Hrolf helps him patch it.
- **Day 3:** Skögul hints that one soul has come back twice (Thorvald). Thorvald mentions he feels fine while everyone else looks cold. At night a stranger (Loki, unnamed) says "Lovely nails." and reacts to how you stamped Thorvald (home, Valhalla or Hel). His lips are crossed with small stitch scars: the Day 12 tell. The dead woman's nails grow: Naglfar foreshadowing.
- **Day 4:** Freyja claims her share. Your answer moves Freyja's or Odin's standing. Ulf sweeps Hallbjorn's smithy. If you paid for the roof, Old Hrolf is in the queue (story soul, HEL; `hrolf_judged`): he died in his chair two days after finishing it, and your mother's letter says so.
- **Day 5:** Rán and the drowned. At night Asa has the winter fever (`fx: family sister sick`) unless she's already sick or away. Skögul can lend you 10 rings (`owes_skogul`). Solveig Arnesdottir, a neighbour drowned at the herring, is in the queue (story soul, RÁN; `solveig_judged`); Ulf's letter carries the news. Without the roof, the rain comes in over Asa's bed.
- **Day 6:** Odin's clerks bring the registry. Oathbreakers keep the ring they broke (the cue). Geir Hallsson, who sat at your father's table, is in the registry and says he isn't. The night depends on his stamp: his widow's bread (`geir_hel`), or the stranger praising your mercy (`geir_spared`, +1 Loki); judged and sent anywhere else, the night says so (`geir_judged`). If you promised medicine on Day 5 (`promised_medicine`), Asa writes, sick or better.
- **Day 7:** The rune-lens, owners' runes and copied Ulfberhts (the copies are spelled right). At night Ulf's smith is taken for selling fake Ulfberhts, and Ulf carved the letters. Pay his share of the fine, 15 rings (`ulf_fine_paid`), or let him face it (`ulf_debt`). If you asked about namesakes on Day 6, Skögul sets the two side by side (`asked_namesake`).
- **Day 8:** Naglfar and the clippers. At night the stranger asks you not to clip, now and then, and offers a place on the ship for anyone you name: give him your family's names (`loki_deal`, Loki +2), refuse (`refused_loki`) or ask who he is. By day Hallbjorn the smith is in the queue, killed beside the jarl's cousin and swearing his copied Ulfberht is real (story soul, VALHALLA; what he says about Ulf depends on the fine).
- **Day 9:** Draupnir's payday. If you owe Skögul, pay her back (−10) or put it off. At night Ulf is offered shipyard work in the north by a man with very clean hands: tell him to go (`ulf_shipyard`, +10 rings from his advance) or stay (`ulf_home`). His letter reports Hallbjorn's death, and, if you paid the fine, that the advance would be all theirs. If you sent Thorvald home on Day 3 (`thorvald_returned`), he's back in the queue, still alive (story soul, RETURN). First in line, ahead of everyone, is Jarl Asgaut Thorolfsson (docs/tech-spec.md §47): he died in his bed with his sword put in his hand, and offers 30 rings for a Valhalla stamp. Take them (`jarl_bribe`, a wrong stamp with its citation, and the rings at the audit) or send him to Hel (`jarl_refused`). That night, if you took them, you count them in with the rest.
- **Day 10:** The clerk of the White Christ sets up his table. Shaking his hand is clerk +1. At night: the man baptized twenty times for the shirts. Help with the form (`helped_clerk`, clerk +1) or ask about his end of the table (`heard_pension`). If Ulf went north, Bard, a shipwright from his yard, is in the queue: drowned off the scaffold, nails long (story soul, RÁN, clipped first).
- **Day 11:** Forged tallies and their three tells. At night a carver has been selling families better tallies for their dead; he offered one for Grandfather (or, if she's gone, for Mother). Tell the truth (`letters_honest`), ask for his name (`reported_carver`, Odin +1) or tell a kindness (`letters_kind`). If Asa is sick, a healer will cure her for the winter for 15 rings (`fx: family sister well`). Your mother has heard that a man from Ulf's shipyard fell into the fjord.
- **Day 12:** Skögul explains Brokkr's scars; the clerk of the White Christ has his own table. If you met the stranger, tell Skögul (`told_skogul`, Odin +1) or keep quiet (`kept_quiet`, Loki +1). The story soul Hrafn Sigurdsson is Loki and knows you: DETAIN sets `loki_detained` (Odin +1), VALHALLA `loki_in_valhalla` (Loki +2). At night the stranger comes back either way, holding a letter from home. If Ulf went north he is building Loki's ship; if he stayed, Loki knows about the Ulfberhts. He'll leave your brother (or family) out of his report if you leave him out of yours: name him (`reported_loki`, Odin +2, Loki −2) or cover for him (`covered_loki`, Loki +2, Odin −1).
- **Day 13 (the midpoint twist):** both ravens report. At night Muninn tells you Odin woke the seeress and knows how it ends, his own death included. Ask what else she said (`truth` +1: "something green, after"), ask why Odin goes on (Odin +1), or ask whether Skögul knows. If you reported the carver, Bjarni is in the queue, drowned by the jarl and carrying his own forged tally (story soul, RÁN). If you let Loki through on Day 12, Skögul says he has a seat on Odin's benches (`loki_in_valhalla`). Muninn has forgotten what he came to say, but he remembers the jarl: his thirty rings on your table (`jarl_bribe`), or that you sent him to Hel anyway (`jarl_refused`).
- **Day 14:** Hel's hall is full and her straw deaths go to the clerk, who has "plenty of room" (offering help is clerk +1). If you helped him on Day 10, his twenty-shirt man has asked for a twenty-first (`helped_clerk`). At night Móðguðr, who keeps the bridge to Hel, says Hel is on strike until someone at the gate says the quiet dead count. Ask about Grandfather (`truth` +1: he sits near Baldr, who walks out into the new world after the fire). Then side with Hel (`sided_hel`, Hel +2, Odin −1), with Odin (Odin +1, Hel −1), or neither.
- **Day 15:** Freyja asks you to send her the souls Odin now claims. Side with her (`sided_freyja`, Freyja +2, Odin −1), with the decree (`sided_odin`, Odin +2, Freyja −1), or with the Order. At night a ferryman at the fjord's mouth offers the family a shore the wolf won't reach: 20 rings now (`ferryman`), 100 on the day, or wait (`ferryman_doubted`). If nobody reported the carver, Bjarni dies of old age and brings his forged tally to the gate; Hel's hall is full, so he's the clerk's (story soul, TRANSFER).
- **Day 16:** Liars forfeit the halls. Thorvald is in the queue, still alive (story soul, RETURN; `thorvald16_judged`, `thorvald16_returned`). At dusk he tells you about Hoddmímir's wood, where nothing finds you: ask about it and Skögul tells the song of the two who survive the fire (`truth` +1, `wood_known`). If you asked on Day 3 whether anyone comes back twice, she points him out (`asked_twice`).
- **Day 17 (the family's fate):** Skögul tells how Odin marked himself with a spear. At night home asks where the family should be when the horn blows. The ship (if you have Loki's deal, or Ulf is at the shipyard: `loki_deal`), the ferry (`ferryman`, or pay the 20 now), Hoddmímir's wood (if you know of it: `wood`), or home together (`stay_home`). Each choice drops the others. Whether your letters have been more honest or more kind (`letters_honest`, `letters_kind`) colours how the letter lands, and a ferry place bought after waiting (`ferryman_doubted`) gets a one-word reply. By day Thrand, an old skald with the spear mark, is in the queue (story soul, VALHALLA).
- **Day 18:** The last Draupnir. The clerk offers a transfer to his department, "unaffected" by Ragnarök, for a 10-ring fee (`clerk_contract`, clerk +2). After the third soul, Odin comes to the desk in a grey hood and a wide hat (docs/tech-spec.md §46): he knows about the ship, and with a deal the player admits it (`told_odin`, Odin +1) or denies it (`lied_to_odin`, Odin −2); that night Loki knows which. At night Loki's last offer: keep the deal (Loki +1) or break it (`broke_loki`, Loki −3, Odin +1); without a deal, take it now (`loki_deal`, which replaces Day 17's plan) or refuse. The clerk remembers you asked about his end (`heard_pension`); Loki remembers your report (`reported_loki`, `covered_loki`) and your first no (`refused_loki`).
- **Day 19 (the last night):** Skögul will ride out tomorrow; she forgives your debt. If you've learned anything of the after, she tells the rest of the song: the green earth, Baldr, the gold game pieces in the grass (`truth` +1). Then who you ride with in your heart: Odin, Freyja or Hel +3, or nobody. Skögul remembers whether you told her about the stranger (`told_skogul`, `kept_quiet`) and whom you sided with before (`sided_odin`, `sided_freyja`, `sided_hel`). If you broke Loki's deal, his end of the table is empty (`broke_loki`). By day Halla, the midwife who delivered you, is in the queue (story soul, TRANSFER), and at noon a raven brings word that Freyja has changed her mind (`decree.d19.noon`, docs/tech-spec.md §45).
- **Day 20:** Ragnarök. The horn, the einherjar riding out, the surge queue. The night's scene sets nothing; it shows where your family is (wood, ferry, ship or home) before the ending.
- **The slice's jump (Days 4–11):** a vertical-slice run jumps from Day 3's night to Day 12 (`campaign.yaml` `slice`). The jump stands in for the skipped days: +30 rings, Odin, Freyja and the clerk +1, and the flags `slice` and `ulf_shipyard` (Ulf found work at a shipyard in the north). Day 12's morning opens with a paragraph summing up those days when `slice` is set.

Flags the drafts set: `told_skogul`, `kept_quiet`, `loki_judged`, `loki_detained`, `loki_in_valhalla`, `reported_loki`, `covered_loki` (Day 12); `asked_about_lies`, `asked_twice`, `asked_namesake`, `letters_kind`, `letters_honest`, `roof_mended`, `met_loki`, `promised_medicine`, `owes_skogul`; from Thorvald's stamps `thorvald_met`, `thorvald_returned`, `thorvald_valhalla`, `thorvald16_judged`, `thorvald16_returned`; from Geir's `geir_judged`, `geir_hel`, `geir_spared`; from the phase 2 souls' `hrolf_judged`, `solveig_judged`; Days 7–20: `ulf_fine_paid`, `ulf_debt`, `loki_deal`, `refused_loki`, `ulf_shipyard`, `ulf_home`, `helped_clerk`, `heard_pension`, `reported_carver`, `truth` (a count), `sided_hel`, `sided_freyja`, `sided_odin`, `ferryman`, `ferryman_doubted`, `wood_known`, `wood`, `stay_home`, `clerk_contract`, `broke_loki`. The endings read `loki_deal`, `truth`, `wood`, `ferryman` and `clerk_contract`; later scenes, threads and story souls' `when` read the rest. `pnpm story:script` lists any flag that's set but read nowhere; since phase 2 there are none.

## Endings and the story choices that reach them

Endings are checked every night in order; the first that holds ends the run (`content/packs/campaign/campaign.yaml`). Standing moves through the story choices above and through wrong stamps (a soul sent where a god wanted it).

| Ending | Needs | Reached through |
|---|---|---|
| Naglfar sails early | Day 18 or later, `loki_deal`, 10+ souls sent on with their nails uncut | Loki's deal (Day 8, the ship on Day 17, or Day 18), then leaving nails long on purpose. Each is a citation. |
| The green earth (the true ending) | Day 20, `wood`, `truth` 3+, a strong host (ragnarok 260+), someone at home | Asking on Days 13, 14, 16 and 19 (three of the four), and Hoddmímir's wood on Day 17 |
| Smuggled home | Day 20, `ferryman`, 100+ rings (the fare), someone at home | The ferry (Day 15 or 17), and saving the fare |
| The transfer | Day 20, `clerk_contract`, clerk standing 4+ | The contract (Day 18), and helping the clerk (Days 10 and 14) |
| Hel's steward | Day 20, Hel leads the factions, Hel 3+ | Siding with Hel (Days 14 and 19) |
| Freyja's own | Day 20, Freyja leads, Freyja 3+ | Siding with Freyja (Days 4, 15 and 19) |
| Chooser eternal | Day 20, Odin leads | Siding with Odin |
| The wolf wins | Day 20, a weak host (ragnarok 240 or less) | Judging badly, or leaving nails long on purpose |
| The last stand | Day 20, otherwise | Everything else |

The two failures (demoted, and an empty house) can end any night.

## Writing a scene

One Ink file per scene in a pack's `scenes/` folder. The file name is the scene id: `d3.night.ink` is `scene.d3.night`. A day plays its scenes by naming them in its day spec:

```yaml
scenes: { morning: scene.d3.morning, night: scene.d3.night }
```

Scenes keep no Ink state from one to the next. Memory across days lives in the run's **flags**, which scenes read and set.

**Reading the run.** Declare what you use; these are the only externals the game provides:

```ink
EXTERNAL flag(name)      // a flag's value, 0 if never set
EXTERNAL standing(faction)   // odin, freyja, hel, loki, clerk
EXTERNAL rings()
EXTERNAL day()
EXTERNAL home(id)        // 1 if that family member isn't gone
EXTERNAL sick(id)        // 1 if they're sick tonight
```

**Changing the run.** Only through `# fx:` tags. They're collected as the scene plays and applied once when it ends:

```ink
You send what you can. # fx: rings -5
# fx: standing freyja +1
# fx: flag owes_loki            (sets it to 1)
# fx: flag thorvald +1          (adds 1)
# fx: flag deals = 2            (sets it to 2)
# fx: family sister sick        (or: well)
```

A tag on its own line attaches to the next line of text, which is fine inside a choice's branch. **Don't put fx tags on a choice line.** Ink can attach them to the choice instead of the text, and then they never fire. The compiler rejects them there.

**What an option costs.** An option that needs rings stays in sight when the purse can't cover it, greyed out with what it needs ("20 rings; you have 12"). Write the cost as a tag inside the option's brackets, not as an Ink condition:

```ink
* [Send twenty rings for a place on the ferry. #needs: rings 20]
  # fx: rings -20
```

Keep story gates as conditions: an option that depends on what the player knows or has done (`{ flag("wood_known") }`) should stay out of sight until it's open, because showing it would give it away. Every choice point needs at least one option the player can take; the compiler's walks fail a scene where every option is locked.

**The player sees standing change.** After the text that follows a choice, just before the next choice or the end of the scene, the game adds a note for each power whose standing that stretch moved: "Hel will remember that (+3)." Effects before the first choice get their note just before it. So put a standing effect in the branch of the choice that earns it, and don't count on a standing change staying secret. Before Day 12 Loki's notes say "The stranger" (`aliases` in the demo's `campaign.yaml`); don't name him in text before then either. Rings, flags and the family get no notes: the purse, the story and the night's news show those.

**Choices.** Write each choice's whole text in brackets and what happens on the following lines:

```ink
* ["What if they lie?"]
  "They will." # speaker: skogul
```

The game echoes the picked option as its own line (so a reply never appears without the question it answers). Text outside the brackets would print a second time, so the compiler rejects it. Put a `speaker:` tag only on lines that are that character's words; narration has no speaker.

**Other tags.**
- `# speaker: skogul` names who is talking. It needs a `speaker.skogul` string.
- `# draft` as the first line marks the whole scene as placeholder writing.

**What the compiler checks** (`pnpm content:compile`):
- Ink errors and warnings.
- Only the externals above.
- Choices written as `[whole text]`.
- Every fx tag parses, reached or not, and is plain text.
- Every day's scene exists and every scene is played by some day.
- Speaker strings exist.
- Family members named in effects exist.

It also walks **every choice path** of each scene in three sample runs: a fresh one, one gone badly (everyone sick, every flag set, in debt) and one gone well (someone already gone). Each path must end within 500 paths. These walks are a smoke test, not a proof over all runs: a condition that only goes wrong at, say, exactly 7 rings isn't covered.

## The journal

The journal (the Journal button, morning and night) keeps every scene the player has played, with their choices, and lists what's still in play: the threads in `campaign.yaml`. Each thread is a string shown while its condition holds (the same conditions as endings, on the run's state):

```yaml
threads:
  - { id: thread.ferry, when: { state: flags.ferryman, gte: 1 }, text: thread.ferry }
  - { id: thread.truth, when: { state: flags.truth, gte: 1 }, text: thread.truth, count: flags.truth }
```

`count` puts a number in the text as `{n}`. A thread says what the player would remember, not what it leads to, and names nobody the story hasn't named yet (the deal is "the man with the scarred lips", before and after Day 12). When a flag is cleared (a plan dropped on Day 17), its thread goes. Past scenes are played again from what the scene could see when it was played, so rewriting a scene updates the journal too; if a rewrite changes a scene's choices, the journal says the scene has been rewritten instead of guessing.

## Writing a story soul

A story soul is a case written for the story, one YAML file per soul in a pack's `cases/` folder. It's generated like any other soul, from truth constraints, lies and personas, but with a fixed name and look and its own seed, so it's the same soul in every run. A day places it in the queue:

```yaml
queue:
  scripted:
    - { case: case.thorvald1, at: 4 }   # 0-based position; generated souls keep theirs
```

Fields:
- `expect`: where it must be sent. The compiler generates the soul for every day that places it, under every day param choice (Freyja's whims), and fails if it can't be made or would go elsewhere.
- `lines`: string keys for extra things the soul says. They claim nothing, so they can't change the judgment.
- `when`: a run condition (the same language as endings) for whether it appears at all.
- `words`: words its generated lines use, by pool: `{ pool.weapons: seax }` gives a fisherwoman a knife in every line instead of a random weapon. A fact's own words still win (an Ulfberht is always a sword), so pin the fact too if it matters (`blade: { is: plain }`).
- `onStamp`: story effects by the stamp used, applied at the audit. `'*'` matches any stamp; an unjudged soul does nothing.

Define a story soul in the pack of the day that places it (demo for Days 1–3, campaign after). The compiler reports a soul no day places. Put its name in that pack's `names.reserved.*` pool (`pools.yaml`) so no generated soul has it; the compiler checks that too.

Read a new soul's lines with its generated ones, as the game shows them: a soul says generic lines about how it died and its weapon too, and a written line that tells a different story (a horse, when its generated line says an axe) reads as a contradiction.
