# Daily Shift alpha: launch checklist

M3 builds everything the public Daily alpha needs. This page lists what only the
repository owner can do. Steps 1 and 5 are required; the rest can wait.

## 1. Put the web demo online (required)

1. Merge `claude/vikings-game-concepts-69zso3` into `main`.
2. **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions.** The *Deploy web demo* workflow
   then publishes every push to `main` at <https://rcjlabs.github.io/Vikings-R-Us/>.
3. **Settings → Branches:** protect `main` and require the *CI* check.

The Pages build is a PWA. Players get an "Update now" prompt on the title
screen (never mid-shift) when a new version is deployed.

## 2. itch.io

1. Create the project on itch.io (kind: HTML). Suggested embed options:
   viewport 1280 × 800, "Mobile friendly", fullscreen button on.
2. Create an API key (itch.io → Settings → API keys) and add it as the
   repository secret `BUTLER_API_KEY`.
3. Add the repository variable `ITCH_TARGET`, e.g. `rcjlabs/chooser-of-the-slain:html5`.
4. Push to `main` (or run *Deploy itch.io* by hand). After the first upload,
   tick "This file will be played in the browser" on the itch edit page.

Without the secret and variable the itch workflow skips itself.

## 3. Telemetry (optional; strongly recommended for tuning)

It's opt-in and anonymous; `docs/privacy.md` says exactly what is sent. Setup
is in `apps/telemetry/README.md`: a free Cloudflare account, one D1 database, two
secrets, then the repository variable `TELEMETRY_URL`. Until that variable is
set, the game shows no telemetry option at all.

Not legal advice: the privacy note is written to be accurate for what the code
does. Check whether your situation needs more (for example a contact address).

## 4. Links (optional)

Repository variables, picked up by the Pages and itch builds:

| Variable | Shows |
|---|---|
| `COMMUNITY_URL` | A "Community" link (Discord invite, forum, …) |
| `STEAM_URL` | "Wishlist on Steam" in demo builds (after the store page exists, M6) |
| `TELEMETRY_URL` | The opt-in telemetry question and setting |

Feedback and "Report this soul" open GitHub issue forms (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE`).
Issues are already enabled. Create the labels `alpha`, `playtest` and
`soul-report` so the forms can apply them. Players need a GitHub account to
submit; the report text can also be copied and pasted anywhere, such as the
community channel.

## 5. Decide before launch (required)

- **Daily #1's date.** `DAILY_EPOCH` in `packages/engine/src/calendar.ts` is still
  the placeholder 2026-12-01. Until that date the game offers an unnumbered
  "Daily preview". Set it to the day the public alpha starts. Changing it later
  renumbers every Daily in people's share texts.
- **Steam Direct fee** ($100 per app). Paying during M3 starts Valve's 30-day
  wait before a release is possible.
- **A community channel**, if you want one, and its link (`COMMUNITY_URL`).

## 6. Testers

M2's exit criterion still stands: five outside testers finish a Daily, on a
phone and on a desktop. Suggest they take the primer first, then the Daily,
and use "Send feedback" and "Report this soul".
